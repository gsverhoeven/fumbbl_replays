    "With the data I like to develop a nice viz, working with board positions together with the roster. \n",
    "When that goes somewhere I will scale it up to order 100, and try to make plots that either stack / aggregate formations, or do a cluster analysis on the start up formations, and see what can be learned from all of this ðŸ™‚ "
