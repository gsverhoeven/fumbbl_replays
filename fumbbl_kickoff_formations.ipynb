    "(We also need to describe the \"state\" of the pieces, as players can be either standing, prone, or stunned, and can be in various special states such as \"Bone head\", \"Rooted\", \"Hypnotized\" etc. A full game state also contains additional information on rerolls, players on the bench etc. This is not yet implemented)\n",

    "Let's start with the location of the pieces. A grid reference system is needed.\n",
    "The game board of Blood Bowl has dimensions 15 x 26.\n",

    "By using numbers for the long axis, we can easily deduce that a Gutter Runner at position c15 is in scoring position: It needs 11 movement to score a touchdown at c26.\n",
