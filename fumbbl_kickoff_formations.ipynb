    "# Introducing the fumbbl_replays Python package\n",
    "\n",
    "I am a Blood Bowl scholar who like to perform Nufflytics in Python.\n",
    "On the FUMBBL website, a lot of high quality replay data is available as well as an API to conveniently fetch the data.\n",
    "In addition, the API provides up to date roster information.\n",
    "To do useful work with this data, we need a utility package / library.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need a standard way to describe Blood Bowl games in a compact way, that is both human and machine readable.\n",
    "If we could converge on a standard Fantasy Football Game Notation, it serve would many purposes:\n",
    "* It would allow us to interchange data between software\n",
    "* it would help to train AI engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In chess, there is the ***Portable Game Notation (PGN)**, which has become the de facto standard of describing Chess games.\n",
    "For Blood Bowl, already in 2002 some work has been done towards this end. David Morgan-Mar developed a notation for the purpose of sharing game logs over the internet. [https://www.dangermouse.net/games/bloodbowl/rules.html]\n",
    "\n",
    "So the package is being developed with this end goal in mind. As Blood Bowl is a much complexer game than Chess, we need some intermediate goals that bring us closer to the end goal. Thus, I started with extracting board positions, short hand notation for board pieces (players) and codifying player moves."

    "# Plotting Blood Bowl board positions\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to describe a board state, we need to describe the pieces, and we need to describe the location of the pieces.\n",
    "(We also need to describe the \"state\" of the pieces, as players can be either standing, prone, or stunned, and can be in various special states such as \"Bone head\", \"Rooted\", \"Hypnotized\" etc. A full game state also contains additional information on rerolls, players on the bench etc. This is not yet implemented)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the location of the pieces. A grid reference system is needed.\n",
    "The game board of Blood Bowl has dimensions 15 x 26.\n",
    "It has cognitive benefit to use numbers for one dimension, and letters for the other dimensions. Fancy word: alphanumeric.\n",
    "Chess over the centuries has had various notations, and this notation is the one that became universally accepted.\n",
    "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)]\n",
    "The only choice left for us is then, which axis should have letters, and which axis should have the numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong argument was made on the BotBowl discord that distance to the end zone is very important in BB.\n",
    "By using numbers for the long axis, we can easily deduce that a Gutter Runner at position c15 is in scoring position: It needs 11 movement to score a touchdown at c26.\n",
    "This notation is also used by Cow Daddy Gaming in his \"WhatÂ´s the play\" puzzles.\n",
